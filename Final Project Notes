Final Project Notes


Viska: Scaling Deep RL on landmark localization (medical imaging)

- 2D Deep Q Network
- Anatomical Localization 
- +1 for moving the square to the correct area, -1 for moving it to the incorrect area.
- Target network and current network found by minimizing the Huber Loss
- TD and Q learning lead to experience wasting
- Replay buffer. Store each experience in a tuple and then do uniform sampling 
- Correlated actions
- Improve experience replay: use importance sampling. Lower frequency events should be valued higher.
- Count sketch algorithm 


Samarth: Automated Lane Changing with Deep Q-Learning

- Environment: PyGame Environment
- Actions: go left, go right, speed up, slow down
- good visual demonstrations
