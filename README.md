Fantasy Premier League reinforcement learning. For their final class project in Reinforcement Learning, Bhawramaett and Colin recreated several classical reinforcement learning algorithms (such as Sarsa and Q-Learning) to optimize the performance of a fantasy Premier League team over the course of a season.

The problem was inspired by Colin's use of mixed-integer programming to select his initial team, but he lacked a good selection criterion to optimize for. The use of reinforcement learning made sense as the selection of the team over the season is a type of Markov Decision Process. However, the vast size of the state space (38 league games and over 500 players to choose from per week) made constructing the state-action space challenging, so we did not see significant improvement in the performance over the season. Creating a regression for expected points and optimizing for that may be a more straightforward and still positive approach.
